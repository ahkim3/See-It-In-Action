# See It In Action

> Program that generates 40 blobs of random size placed randomly within a framed area, with randomized initial angles. Velocity based upon blob size. When two blobs collide, the larger absorbs the smaller, and thus their areas combine. Blobs of equal size bounce off each other and increase their speed by 20%.
